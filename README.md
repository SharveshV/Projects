Machine Learning and Data Science Learning Journey,

This repository documents my structured learning path toward becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.

It contains hands-on projects built using Python, NumPy, Pandas, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques.

Goals:
- Build strong foundations in Python and data handling
- Develop real-world data analysis skills
- Implement machine learning models
- Maintain a consistent learning and project portfolio
